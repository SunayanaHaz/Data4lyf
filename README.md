- What types of violations occur most frequently?
- Which pages cause the greatest harm to users?

## Methods
- Data cleaning and aggregation using Python
- Descriptive analytics and visualization
- Severity-weighted Risk Score to rank harmful pages

## Outputs
- Markdown report: `accessibility_analysis.md`
- Jupyter Notebook: `accessibility_analysis.ipynb`
- Visualizations (PNG)
- Top harmful pages table (CSV)
